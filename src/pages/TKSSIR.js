            The Stay Kind Foundation (then known as the Thomas Kelly Foundation) is a charity foundation that ran a 
            program called Take Kare. The program deploy teams and safe spaces in various nightlife hotspots across 
            the city of Sydney on weekends. Their volunteer teams render assistance to tens of thousands of youths and 
            homeless every year, helping them reach home, reconnect with family or find safety every weekend.

            In partnership with UTS:Rapido, the foundation commissioned the development of an application that would 
            support them in the collection of anonymous client data that needed to be hand filled, collected and 
            processed at the end of each shift. This collected data was to help the foundation understand where better 
            to deploy their teams and how better to utilise their resources.
